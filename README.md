# GPSrocket
GPS transciever and reciever for model rocket.
Discalimer: A lot of the basic code comes from other peoples work. It all should have a name associated with it. It was all found publicly available online. 
GPS_raw_data is just the single GPS running and printing all of the data it's getting.
GPS_pretty is the single GPS but prints out the data in a clean way and removes extraneous data that you don't care for.
GPS_reciever and GPS_transmitter are the official code to run on the arduinos.
reciver_code and transmitter_code are to make sure the LoRa serial communication is functional and working.
